# Introduction

The aim of PERK is to predict and visualize concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous environment.

PERK acronym for **P**redicting **E**nvironmental concentration and **R**is**K**, is an R/Shiny application tool, aims to facilitate automated modelling and reporting of predicted environmental concentrations of a comprehensive set of pharmaceuticals derived from a wide range of therapeutic classes with different mode of action.

The tool helps users,

-   to input their measured concentration,
-   to compare the predicted and measured concentrations of the APIs by means of the PEC/MEC ratio,
-   to establish whether the predicted equations used tend to underestimate or overestimate measured values.
-   It provides a consistent interactive user interface in a familiar dashboard layout, enabling users to visualise predicted values and compare with their measured values without any hassles.
-   Users can download data and graphs generated using the tool in .csv or publication ready images (.pdf, .eps).

# Data sources:

## Prescription Data For England:

This tool uses the prescription data from [PrAna](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-021-01727-z), an R package to calculate and visualize England NHS prescribing data.

The data used in PrAna are as follows,

-   Prescribing data and Practice information are from the monthly files published by the NHS Business Service Authority, used under the terms of the Open Government Licence.

-   BNF codes and names are also from the NHS Business Service Authority's Information Portal, used under the terms of the Open Government Licence.

-   dm+d weekly release data is also from the NHS Business Service Authority's Information Portal, used under the terms of the Open Government Licence.

## WWTP Data:

The following dataset are provided from WWTP collaborators,

-   Catchment map used to define the boundaries and capture the GP Practices inside the catchments for the prescription data calculations.

-   Daily flow data used to calculate the load and population equivalent.

-   Population Equivalent number of inhabitants per catchment zone.

-   Site information required to predict information such as recovery percentage.

-   Water quality parameters to predict population equivalent.

## API properties

-   Metabolites and Excretion factors collected from research articles and data repositories such as Drug bank.
-   Recovery percentage collected from research articles, calculated from measured concentration from previous experiments, predicted using WWTP site information.
-   Physio-chemical properties collected from research articles and data repositories.
-   Site information required to predict information such as recovery percentage.
-   Eco-toxicity data collected from research articles and data repositories.
