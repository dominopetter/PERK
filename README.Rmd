## Description
`PERK` is an R package containing a tool (Shiny App) to predict and visualize environmental concentration and risk using pharmaceutical prescription data collected at fine spatial resolution.

The tool helps users to input their measured concentration, to compare the predicted (PEC) and measured concentrations (MEC) of the pharmaceuticals by means of the PEC/MEC ratio, to establish whether the predicted equations used tend to underestimate or overestimate measured values.

It provides a consistent interactive user interface in a familiar dashboard layout, enabling users to visualise predicted values and compare with their measured values without any hassles. Users can download data and graphs generated using the tool in .csv or publication ready images.

## Getting started
Although the main purpose of the R package is to be installed and used locally, you can give it a quick [online test run](http://51.141.234.162/shiny/DemoPERK/) to determine whether it's right for you before installing it. With just 3 commands, you can install it and begin using it if you like what you see:
```r
install.packages('PERK')
library('PERK')
run_app()
```
For an introduction to the package, step-by-step instructions on getting
started, and more information on the different ways you can use the package [*PERK-Walkthrough*](https://jkkishore85.github.io/PERK/articles/PERK-Walkthrough.html) tutorial.

You can install the development version of `PERK` from GitHub through following command.
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("jkkishore85/PERK")
```
